After you create an account, log-in to trackstar using the log-in section.  Upon login you will be redirected to the home page.

The data is pulled from a free Coingecko API so too many requests will prevent you from loading an updated list if you refresh the page too many times. To load the rest of the 20 coin list, press the 'Load More' button.

To add a coin to your watchlist click the star button in the 'Favorite' column.  You can also view an interactive chart of that cryptocurrency by clicking the 'View' button in the 'View Chart' column.

After adding a few favorites, click the 'Favorites' button at the top of the screen (in hamburger menu on mobile).  You can view all your favorites on this list, adding/removing new coins any time they show up on the trending list.
